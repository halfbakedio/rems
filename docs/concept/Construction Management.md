Had a shower idea for an app to manage connections between home owners, general contractors, and trades people. Could this be integrated into the same app to avoid setup and use a different domain to route to different apps. This could look like app.shiftr.io for REMS and app.tradr.io (?) for construction management application.

Ideas for licensing

- user planning to build a home
	- free
		- ability to submit designs
		- ability to connect to GC
	- paid
		- everything free plus
		- ability to connect with trades if trades have license and allow it
		- ability to view schedule
- user operating as a general contractor
	- free
	- paid
- user operating as a trade
	- free
		- ability to add and update expected dates (start, completion)
	- paid
		- everything free plus
		- ability to search for and bid on jobs
		- ability to create connections with home owners
